### A note about routing
Since this is a React Single Page Application (SPA), you may find that if you refresh the page for a URL other than `/` in production build
that you get `404` message. This is because when you refresh the page at a deeper URL, your client-side router (`react-router`) in this project
has not got chance to load and handle routing. Therefore, since your do not have a server (in this project), you
get `404` back.

A nice explanation is available on [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36623117/379235)

There are 2 places we need to resolve this problem - at production build hosted locally, and production build hosted on
provider.

#### Production build hosted locally

This project uses [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) which has a flag
called `-s` ([Github](https://github.com/vercel/serve/blob/main/bin/serve.js#L84)). This flag re-writes all non-found
requests to `index.html`. This loads javascript code at `/`, which kicks off the client-side router, hence making URL
refreshes work.

#### Production build hosted on Vercel (provider)

This project is hosted on Vercel, so we needed to write a configuration called `vercel.json`, which is
available [here](/vercel.json).

If you are using Firebase Hosting, refer
to [their documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#rewrites) on how to configure re-writes.

For other provides, I encourage folks to update this documentation by opening up a PR. If you do, please provide the
reference to the official documentation.
